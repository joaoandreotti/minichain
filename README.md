# Minichain
A distributed ledger project

# About
This project aims to implement a distributed ledger in python3.
Most of the idea was based on the [bitcoin developer page](https://developer.bitcoin.org/devguide/index.html).
I made some change on the architecture to make things a lot simpler based on my experience. In the future this simplifications probably won`t be efficient or valid enough, so they must disappear.
